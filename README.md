# PhoneNumber
I have chosed this exercise as I was able to grasp it easily and considering the time factor, this proved to be simpler than the other two challenges.
I've strived to ensure as much test cases as possible and have introduced refactoring to break down functions.
The code is built on java 1.8 and few feature of 1.8 have also been used.
Code has been built using Intellij Idea 15 and can be executed by pulling the code into any repository and opening the PhoneNumber project in the IDE.
Code relies on recursion for simplicity.
